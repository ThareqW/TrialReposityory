My resolution of 2023:
1. Learn Git and Github vor Version Control System
2. Full-stack web development:
    -Learn Stramlit or Dash for a quick creation of web-based content
    -Learn FastApi for back-end development
    -Learn Flutter or Flask for front-end development
3. Learn Machine Learning for data science -> This would be the main focus for the content of the web that I will develop.
